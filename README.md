This project is not meant to be contributed to or used. Made in an academic context.

Steps:

1 - Check if all modules are installed (pip command can be used). Check if all other dependent files are in the same directory (including data/ folder with the dataset).

    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - imageio
    - json 
    - all others that might come up as necessary

How to install? Run the following in an admin-elevated command line, for example:

    pip install numpy 

2 - Change the main.py file as you want.

There are 4 default dataset images. Each one has 2 methods of encoding (LZW and RLEHuff).
    
You just need to uncomment the one you want to encode/decode.

LZW encodings accept a chunk size value but there is a default value which, individually, have the best pre-calculated cost-benefit.

3 - Run the main.py file. No args are accepted. All stuff must be handled in the main.py code.

Example on the command line: python main.py

3 - Enjoy the output. Check if any file was outputted and created (probably).

4- This works!
